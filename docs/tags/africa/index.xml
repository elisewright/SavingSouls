      <description>I am in a wheelchair and went to Africa to see the Gorillas in Rwanda. They carried me in a stretcher and I went and took these videos and edited them myself. It was a wonderful trip. I saw so much and the gorillas were a highlight. Anybody can go and see the gorillas - nothing must hold you back.   </description>
