      <description>No Ordinary Man Cantata a 45 minute Musical revelation, unlike most traditional Cantatas, is taken from the perspective of the Jewish occupants of the house where Jesus and his Disciples spent their last night in Jerusalem. From our Lord&amp;rsquo;s introduction of the sacrament of Holy Communion in the upstairs chamber, to His prayerful journey to the Garden of Gethsemane leading to His betrayal, arrest, crucifixion and resurrection, this musical setting conveys the impressions, feelings in involvement of those closest to Him at the time.</description>
