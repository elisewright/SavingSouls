Are we ready to receive what God wants to give us? We ask God for his purpose to be manifest in our lives but very ofter we are so distracted 
with the pressures and the business of everything else except give our undivided attention to God in communicating with him directly. So he can't 
get through to us because we aren't listening with our hearts because our hearts are filled with everything else and no room for Him. It is only 
when we give permission to him to help us surrender whats in our hearts, to lay it all down so that he can build us up, it's only when we quiet our 
minds and hearts in this manner from the noise of the world that so easily consumes us that we would be able to hear his still, quiet and gentle 
voice that would speak healing, love, purpose and truth into the depths of where we live and who we are on the inside of ourselves.It is into that 
deepness as the scripture says "deep cries unto deep".
